# nim-strenc
This is a Nim library for automatic encryption (currently via XOR with a different key for each string generated at compile-time) of string literals.
You can install it from Nimble via
```sh
nimble install strenc
```
and then just use it like so:
```nim
import strenc
# After importing the module you don't have to do anything else to activate encryption
echo "hello world"
echo "how are you?"
```
In compiled C code (or in any other backend, strenc works with all of them, although with the JS backend it'll be much easier for "interested" people to get the original contents back) strings will look like this:
```c
STRING_LITERAL(TM__huvhZYSc4ExMXNTyiw83eQ_2, "as{xz2d\177cr{", 11);
STRING_LITERAL(TM__huvhZYSc4ExMXNTyiw83eQ_3, "kov\036^NX\032BWL\011", 12);
```
If you wish to disable all hints for places where the encryption was applied, add ``hint("Pattern", false)``
to your `.nims` config file, or, if you use `.cfg`, ``--hint[Pattern]:off``

### Please do not forget to strip your binaries if you want this library to be useful! Otherwise it'll be much easier to find the code which does string decryption.

## How does it work?
This library uses one of the lesser known Nim features - term-rewriting macros. They allow to implicitly *rewrite* code at compile-time by using different kinds of patterns. You can read more [in the manual here](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual_experimental.html#term-rewriting-macros).

## Why?
Because it's fun and this library can actually help you to protect string data in the application from
not-so-experienced "haxxors".

### Do not forget that a person with enough programming and/or reverse-engineering knowledge will still be able to get the original content of all encrypted strings!
